        <br><h1>About Elisa</h1>
        <div class=about>
            <p>I am a lifelong New Yorker who worked in the medical field for many years before pursuing coding in 2021. I hope to utilize the fundamentals I will learn in my Flatiron course to develop software for the public health sphere.</p>
            <p class="interests">When I'm not coding, I enjoy:
                <ul>
                    <li>Watching Sports - I always have an eye on the Knicks, Yankees, New York Red Bulls, Gotham FC, and Liberty.</li>
                    <li>Exercising - I love going for walks in Central Park and along the East River. During the pandemic, I got a lot of indoor exercise equipment including adjustable dumbbells, yoga blocks, and a small, foldable treadmill.</li>
                    <li>Cooking - I have been a vegetarian for 17 years and have been trying to be a more adventurous chef.</li>
                    <li>TV and Movies - I love appointment prestige television and goofy reality tv; equally exited for critical indie darlings and Space Jam 2.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="moose">My best buddy is my cat, Moose, who is almost 18 years old. She is my coding and TV watching companion.
